# mcp3008gpiozero
simple usage of MCP3008

This code is used to interface with 4 electrical devices namely potentiometer, LDR, and temperature sensors MCP9701 & MCP9700.
Only gpiozero libraries required for this simple test.

Components mapping:

Potentiometer = CH0<br>
LDR = CH1<br>
MCP9701 = CH2<br>
MCP9700 = CH3<br>
