# mcp3008gpiozero
<h2>simple usage of MCP3008<h2> 

This code is used to interface with 4 electrical devices namely potentiometer, LDR, and temperature sensors MCP9701 & MCP9700.
Only gpiozero libraries required for this simple test.

Components mapping:

Potentiometer = CH0
LDR = CH1
MCP9701 = CH2
MCP9700 = CH3
